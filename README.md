# UnityNativePluginBuilder
Unity Native Plugin Builder is an Editor extension to automate the creation and the cross platform compilation of native Unity plugins.

An editor extension is suppsed to help create a new plugin project, and manage all compilation tasks through cmake, from detecting c++ code, to creating projects, compiling code, and copying binaries to the correct plugin folder in the Unity project where it is used, all with a single press of a button.

Multiple plugins with multiple builds are supported.
These platforms are supported when available: Android, iOS, Standalone (Windows, OS X, Linux) and WebGL.

More details coming soon.
