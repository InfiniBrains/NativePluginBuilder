# UnityNativePluginBuilder (WIP)
Unity Native Plugin Builder is an Editor extension to automate the creation and the cross platform compilation of native Unity plugins.

An editor extension is suppsed to help create a new plugin project, and manage all compilation tasks through cmake, from detecting c++ code, to creating projects, compiling code, and copying binaries to the correct plugin folder in the Unity project where it is used, all with a single press of a button.

##### This tool is not yet functional, not until I understand how the fuck cmake works.
